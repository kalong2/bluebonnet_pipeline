2507967 | Likely benign | criteria provided, single submitter | 2020-05-31 | 2020-05-31 | N/A | 2018-01-12 | This variant was observed in the ICSL laboratory as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population. It had not been previously curated by ICSL or reported in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD: prior to June 1st, 2018), and was therefore a candidate for classification through an automated scoring system. Utilizing variant allele frequency, disease prevalence and penetrance estimates, and inheritance mode, an automated score was calculated to assess if this variant is too frequent to cause the disease. Based on the score and internal cut-off values, a variant classified as likely benign is not then subjected to further curation. The score for this variant resulted in a classification of likely benign for this disease.

4065326 | Likely benign | criteria provided, single submitter | 2022-02-12 | 2022-02-12 | N/A | 2022-01-17 | Variant summary: ACADVL c.308A>G (p.Lys103Arg) results in a conservative amino acid change located in the Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase/oxidase, N-terminal domain (IPR013786) of the encoded protein sequence. Four of five in-silico tools predict a benign effect of the variant on protein function. The variant allele was found at a frequency of 0.0014 in 251434 control chromosomes, predominantly at a frequency of 0.012 within the African or African-American subpopulation in the gnomAD database. The observed variant frequency within African or African-American control individuals in the gnomAD database is approximately 4 fold of the estimated maximal expected allele frequency for a pathogenic variant in ACADVL causing Very Long Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency phenotype (0.0029), strongly suggesting that the variant is a benign polymorphism found primarily in populations of African or African-American origin. c.308A>G has been reported in the literature as a VUS in settings of newborn/presumptive screening for Very Long Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (example, Miller_2015). These report(s) do not provide unequivocal conclusions about association of the variant with Very Long Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency. To our knowledge, no experimental evidence demonstrating an impact on protein function has been reported. Seven clinical diagnostic laboratories have submitted clinical-significance assessments for this variant to ClinVar after 2014 without evidence for independent evaluation and a predominant consensus as likely benign/benign (n=6). Based on the evidence outlined above, the variant was classified as likely benign.
5037542 | Uncertain significance | reviewed by expert panel | 2022-10-08 | 2022-10-08 | N/A | 2022-09-23 | The c.308A>G variant in ACADVL has been reported in one proband with elevated C14:1 levels (PP4_moderate; PMID: 27209629). The highest population minor allele frequency in gnomAD v2.1.1 is 1.2% in the African population, which is higher than the ClinGen ACADVL threshold (0.7%) for BA1, and therefore meets this criterion (BA1). The computational predictor REVEL gives a score of 0.35, (which is below the threshold of 0.5) indicating that the variant does not predict a damaging effect on ACADVL function (BP4). Due to conflicting evidence, this variant is classified as a variant of unknown significance for very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, as specified by the ClinGen ACADVL: (PP4_moderate, BA1, BP4).
