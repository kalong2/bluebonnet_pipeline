795482 | Benign | criteria provided, single submitter | 2016-12-06 | 2020-05-31 | N/A | 2017-04-27 | This variant was observed as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population. A literature search was performed for the gene, cDNA change, and amino acid change (where applicable). No publications were found based on this search. Allele frequency data from public databases was too high to be consistent with this variant causing disease. Therefore, this variant is classified as benign.
3049731 | Likely benign | no assertion criteria provided | 2021-04-13 | 2021-04-13 | N/A | N/A | Allele frequency is common in at least one population database (frequency: 9.43% in ONEKG) based on the frequency threshold of 0.772% for this gene. Variant was observed in a homozygous state in population databases more than expected for disease. 1 reputable source/s reports the variant as benign, but the evidence is not available to the laboratory to perform an independent evaluation. A synonymous variant not located in a splice region.
