719833 | Uncertain significance | criteria provided, single submitter | 2016-12-06 | 2019-05-24 | N/A | 2017-04-28 | The ACADVL c.481G>A (p.Ala161Thr) variant has been reported in one study in a compound heterozygous state with another missense variant in one individual with very long-chain-acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency (Boneh et al. 2006). The variant was also identified in a heterozygous state in the unaffected father. Control data are unavailable for this variant which is reported at a frequency of 0.00017 in the total population of the Exome Aggregation Consortium. The Ala161 residue is conserved. The evidence for this variant is limited. The p.Ala161Thr variant is therefore classified as a variant of unknown significance but suspicious for pathogenicity for VLCAD deficiency. This variant was observed by ICSL as part of a predisposition screen in an ostensibly healthy population.

This variant has been reported in PMID: 16488171. This variant meets the following evidence codes reported in the ACMG guidelines: PS1, PS3
4242164 | Uncertain significance | criteria provided, single submitter | 2022-03-28 | 2022-03-28 | N/A | 2021-11-26 | This sequence change replaces alanine, which is neutral and non-polar, with threonine, which is neutral and polar, at codon 161 of the ACADVL protein (p.Ala161Thr). This variant is present in population databases (rs375284481, gnomAD 0.02%). This missense change has been observed in individual(s) with VLCAD deficiency (PMID: 16488171, 16950999). This variant is also known as A121V. ClinVar contains an entry for this variant (Variation ID: 324987). Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function are either unavailable or do not agree on the potential impact of this missense change (SIFT: "Deleterious"; PolyPhen-2: "Benign"; Align-GVGD: "Class C0"). In summary, the available evidence is currently insufficient to determine the role of this variant in disease. Therefore, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.
4036691 | Uncertain significance | criteria provided, single submitter | 2022-01-15 | 2022-11-29 | N/A | 2021-11-03 | NM_000018.3(ACADVL):c.481G>A(A161T) is a missense variant classified as a variant of uncertain significance in the context of very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. A161T has been observed in cases with relevant disease (PMID: 16488171, 16950999, 20480395). Functional assessments of this variant are not available in the literature. A161T has been observed in population frequency databases (gnomAD: AMR 0.02%). In summary, there is insufficient evidence to classify NM_000018.3(ACADVL):c.481G>A(A161T) as pathogenic or benign. Please note: this variant was assessed in the context of healthy population screening.
